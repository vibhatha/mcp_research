However, we changed the MinorKind of the president node to citizen instead of president. This means that we need to change all mentions of its kind as well as modify the way we find the president node (i.e using the IS_PRESIDENT relationship instead of the MinorKind)\n\n**Risks/Blockers:**\n- None\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Complete all changes to integrate the president node\n- Work on the GraphQL PoC\n\n### Issue #181: [EPIC] RAG for Nexoan and OrgChart\n**Latest Update:** 2025-08-07 by @github-actions[bot]\n\n**Epic:** [[EPIC]RAG for Nexoan and OrgChart](https://github.com/LDFLK/launch/issues/181)\n**Owner:** @ChanukaUOJ\n**Status:** On Track\n**Progress:** \n\n**Recent Progress:**\n- By exposing a Chat endpoint I added the functionalities to the chatbot. The below flow chart shows the underneath high level architecture for the chatbot. When the user enter the question it goes to the LLM and the prompt will help the LLM to generate the GraphQL query based on the given GraphQL schema. This GraphQL schema should be included in the prompt also. Once the LLM generates a response with the given format, it goes to the validation function which validates the generated GraphQL query. for that we can use a python package to validate the GraphQL query with the given schema. if the generated graphql query is valid then is ready to go to the GraphQL endpoint, otherwise it will go to the LLM again with the summarize prompt to give a user friendly response to the user. If the query is valid then it will be passed to the GraphQL endpoint call with the query and the variables. then once the LLM returns the response it will be send to the summarize prompt and generate a markdown text in a user friendly way. This is the flow for the chatbot\n\n**Risks/Blockers:**\n- The memory management part for the chatbot is still not completed.\n- need graphQL endpoint for testing purposes.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Going to add the memory management part to the chatbot and after that the architecture will be changed according to that. for now I'm planning to use Redis store as the database to store the chat history for the users.\n\n### Issue #134: [EPIC] Nexoan Code Improvements\n**Latest Update:** 2025-08-12 by @github-actions[bot]\n\n**Epic:** [[EPIC] Nexoan Code Improvements](https://github.com/LDFLK/launch/issues/134)\n**Owner:** @sehansi-9\n**Status:** On Track\n**Progress:** \n\n**Recent Progress:**\n- Created a [PR](https://github.com/LDFLK/nexoan/pull/243) for refactoring internal APIs which needed restructuring.\n\n**Risks/Blockers:**\n- N/A\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Under review.\n\n### Issue #135: [EPIC] Data Archive Platform\n**Latest Update:** 2025-08-07 by @github-actions[bot]\n\n**Epic:** [[EPIC] Data Archive Platform](https://github.com/LDFLK/launch/issues/135)\n**Owner:** @yasandu0505\n**Status:** On Track\n**Progress:** \n\n**Recent Progress:**\n- The initial workflow from data download, metadata gathering, tagging via AI and archiving in Google drive has been completed with a CLI.\n\n**Risks/Blockers:**\n- None\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Working on a UI to visualize the workflow and enable logs and data gathering.\n\n### Issue #150: [EPIC] Data Collection for OrgChart 2.0\n**Latest Update:** 2025-08-07 by @github-actions[bot]\n\n**Epic:** [[EPIC] Data Collection for OrgChart 2.0](https://github.com/LDFLK/launch/issues/150)\n**Owner:** @Megatronn16\n**Status:** On Track\n**Progress:** \n\n**Recent Progress:**\n- CSV uploads for 2016/2017 are done.\n\n**Risks/Blockers:**\n- NA\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- CSV uploads for 2018/2019 have to be completed in the next sprint.\n\n### Issue #177: [EPIC] AI and Automation\n**Latest Update:** 2025-08-12 by @github-actions[bot]\n\n**Epic:** [[EPIC] AI and Automation](https://github.com/LDFLK/launch/issues/177)\n**Owner:** @vibhatha\n**Status:** On Track\n**Progress:** \n\n**Recent Progress:**\n- Focused more on getting AI workflows finalized with an MCP touch.\n\n**Risks/Blockers:**\n- N/A\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Automating update crawling bi-weekly via a Github automation.\n\n### Issue #179: [EPIC] OrgChart Gazette Data Automation\n**Latest Update:** 2025-08-07 by @github-actions[bot]\n\n**Epic:** [[EPIC] OrgChart Gazette Data Automation](https://github.com/LDFLK/launch/issues/179)\n**Owner:** @sehansi-9\n**Status:** On Track\n**Progress:** \n\n**Recent Progress:**\n- Search functionality to get the last ministry a department was under\n- Implementation of the frontend\n\n**Risks/Blockers:**\n- Processing gazette types which has both amendments and tabular structures  https://github.com/LDFLK/launch/issues/214\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Continue implementing the frontend for amendments and polish UI\n- Discuss about blockers\n- More testing and handling edge cases.\n\n### Issue #243: [EPIC]Implement MCP Architecture for Data Platform\n**Latest Update:** 2025-08-07 by @github-actions[bot]\n\n**Epic:** [[EPIC]Implement MCP Architecture for Data Platform](https://github.com/LDFLK/launch/issues/243)\n**Owner:** @Isuru-rangana\n**Status:** On Track\n**Progress:** 60%\n\n**Recent Progress:**\n- MCP research phase completed successfully.\n- Finalized MCP architecture design for the data platform\n- started implementation phase for the data platform\n\n**Risks/Blockers:**\n- No major blockers at this time\n- Complete Gazette Archiver implementation (@Isuru-rangana -by Aug 10)\n\n### Issue #125: [EPIC] HR and Admin\n**Latest Update:** 2025-08-07 by @github-actions[bot]\n\n**Epic:** [[EPIC] HR and Admin](https://github.com/LDFLK/launch/issues/125)\n**Owner:** @Megatronn16\n**Status:** On Track\n**Progress:** \n\n**Recent Progress:**\n- Salaries were processed and Payslips were sent.\n- EPF was paid and receipts were filed.\n- Access cards and lanyards are in review, changes were communicated after seeing the samples.\n\n**Risks/Blockers:**\n- NA\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- ETF needs to be posted.\n- Tags will be given once we approve the changes.\n\n",
